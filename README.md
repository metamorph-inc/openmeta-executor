OpenMETA Remote Execution Service
=================================

The OpenMETA Remote Execution Service provides a job server and remote worker,
enabling remote job execution from the OpenMETA Job Manager.

For build and development instructions, see `README.md` in the `executor-server`
and `executor-worker` directories.  For end-user documentation, see
[`PACKAGE_README.md`](jenkins/PACKAGE_README.md) in the `jenkins` directory
(this document is included in the packaged ZIP file built by Jenkins).
